Real and Complex Float32Array based: create a realFieldFload32Array.js

try ratio, rational numbers lib

docco like layout for examples, see http://g14n.info/algebra/examples/real-vector.html

color space as example, but with color names  white -> 1  black -> 0

example of complex space over custom field

be more semantic: transposition instead of transpose if it is static, transpose if it is a mutator, tha alias is the same (tr)
                  addition for the static operator, add for the mutator
                  subtraction for the static, subtract for the mutator
                  multiplication, multiply or better multiplyBy ... the alias is mul, that is the same

Add the Fano Plane as an example, since it is homomorphyc to Byte example
without 0: it could be used for Scalar example.
